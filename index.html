            <p class="long"><b>Speech compression</b> has been very important since the development of digital communication, allowing better bandwidth and quality for audio calls.
            Since then speech compression continues to play a very important role in allowing applications such as VoIP, virtual assistant like Siri and Alexa and others that are in focus today.
            This project aims to analyze the state of the art of speech compression and produce an report about the subject.
            Also, an implementation of speech compression with focus on speech recognition using latest algorithms is to be developed.</p>

                <li><b>June 16</b>: Initial report on state-of-the-art of speech compression</li>
                <li><b>June 18</b>: Report further information regarding the effect compression has on
                    speech recognition</li>
                <li><b>June 22</b>: Setup development environment for implementation and implement a
                    initial version of speech compression.</li>
                <li><b>June 25</b>: Report on what areas of current speech compression need improvement
                    and how can we achieve it.</li>
                <li><b>June 30</b>: Consolidate report and implementation. If possible, alter implementation
                    using the improvement methods found in the previous step.</li>
